# Practical 07
## What is the practical about?
* The second practical with respect to classes and OOP (Object Orientated Programming)
* Strong focus on "magic methods" and overloading operators
* The datetime module will also appear throughout the practical; and
* Pickle and JSON (Java Object Notation) will be used as an easier way to store memory objects

### Project management Program
* I struggled with the coding for this task.
* I found myself having to research python example code for the datetime module
* It was almost like an assessment piece of its own
