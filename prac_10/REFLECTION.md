# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

* My general accuracy of the estimated time was within +/- 10 mins error.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

* I think my early estimates were off due to the lack of reading and understanding each practical task.
* They improved as I began to engage more deeply with the content. There is still room for further improvement.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

* Estimating helped me understand how long tasks would take, allowing me to plan when to complete practicals during the week.
* Overall, it helped me manage my time better across multiple subjects.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

* I learned the value of constructive feedback. Some review focused on "I did it differently, so here's how you should do it", rather than how the code could be improved.
* I understand everyone is learning code review for the first time so no judgement. It helped me understand that this is the mindset I should avoid in my reviews.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

* People approach tasks in different ways, but the coding style in this subject should remain consistent. 
* This helped me focus on the coding style and naming conventions in my own work, which improved my coding. I've have started to review my code my thoroughly and spotting issues I noticed in my peers' code.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Practical 07 Review](https://github.com/kiruba132/cp1404practicals2/pull/3)

### Explanation

* I used an uplifting tone, praising what my peer did well. For areas of improvement in there code, I posed questions rather than pointing out mistakes.
* I focused on constructive suggestions than wrong or right. 
* I also referenced my own work as something I'm am still improving, which I think fosters a sense of togetherness rather than superiority. Representing a good power balance.


### Good Code Review 2

[Practical 09 Review](https://github.com/MichaelB-G/CP1404/pull/5)

### Explanation

* I kept my comments short and concise, focusing on how the code could be improved.
* I offered suggestions rather than instructions, making it feel more collaborative.
* I made sure to praise what was done well.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

* The practical tasks are great, there is nothing that I would change. They can be time-consuming especially juggling practicals for multiple subjects.
* However, I understand that's part of the learning experience and helps me develop time management skills.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

* I completed them on time and mostly received above satisfactory marks.
* I also gained a deeper understanding of the subject outcomes through completing practicls.
